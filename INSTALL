There are no special installation steps. Just run "make" to build the
program, and "make install" to install it. By default it will be
installed under /usr/local; edit the variable "prefix" at the top of
the Makefile to change this.

There is no configuration script, as the program is written almost
entirely in portable C. There are a handful of functions it needs that
are beyond the standard C library -- specifically, functions that work
with directories. These functions are collected into a single small
file, unixisms.c. Porting the functions in this file is all that would
be needed to port cppp to a non-Unix platform. (An example of such a
replacement file is included, named unixisms-win32.c. Replace
unixisms.c with this file to build cppp for windows.)
