.SH NAME
cppp \- C partial preprocessor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cppp
[OPTIONS] [\fISOURCE\fR ... [\fIDEST\fR]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B cppp
mimics the C preprocessor enough to find the #ifdef, #ifndef, and #if
preprocessor commands, and applies them for the symbols that are
specified on the command line. All other symbols are left unprocessed.
.P
If more than one
.I SOURCE
is specified, then
.I DEST
names a directory, to which all of the partially-preprocessed files
are written with the same names as the original source files.
.P
If
.I DEST
is omitted, the partially-preprocessed
.I SOURCE
is emitted to standard output. If
.I SOURCE
is also omitted,
.B cppp
reads from standard input.
.P
#if lines can contain more than one test (using the defined
preprocessor operator), so such lines may be edited, rather than
merely omitted. Likewise, #elif lines may change into #if or #else
lines.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-D\fR \fISYMBOL\fR[\fB=\fR\fIVALUE\fR]
Treat
.I SYMBOL
as defined to be
.I VALUE
during partial preprocessing. 
.IR VALUE ,
if present, must be an integer constant. If
.I VALUE
is omitted,
.I SYMBOL
will be defined as 1.
.TP
\fB\-U\fR \fISYMBOL\fR
Treat
.I SYMBOL
as undefined during partial preprocessing.
.TP
.B \-t, \--trigraphs
Enable trigraph handling. By default
.B cppp
ignores trigraph sequences in the input files.
.TP
.B \--help
Display help and exit.
.TP
.B \--version
Display version information and exit.
.SH BUGS
Comments on edited preprocessor lines are not always preserved.
.P
It is possible (using nested preprocessor commands) to produce an
empty section in the output.
.B cppp
does not collapse these.
